                By moving common functionalities to packages, the codebase of our apps became smaller and more maintainable.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                The packages each have their own testsuite. When we discover a bug, we can easily distribute the fix in our apps by merely running <code class="opacity-75 text-lg bg-white rounded p-1">composer update</code>.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                There are commercial benefits as well. By open sourcing our packages, our company become much more visible and we've landed cool projects from all around the world.
